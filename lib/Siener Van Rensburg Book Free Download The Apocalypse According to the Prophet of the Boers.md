Siener Van Rensburg was born in 1864 in the Orange Free State, a former Boer republic that is now part of South Africa. He was a devout Christian who believed that God spoke to him through visions. He had his first vision at the age of seven, when he saw a snake biting his father's leg. His father died shortly after from a snake bite.
 
During the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), Siener Van Rensburg joined the Boer commandos as a scout and a spiritual leader. He had many visions of the war and its outcome, which he shared with his fellow Boers. He foresaw the British invasion, the concentration camps, the peace treaty, and the eventual loss of Boer independence. He also predicted the rise of Afrikaner nationalism, the creation of the Union of South Africa, and the establishment of apartheid.
 
After the war, Siener Van Rensburg returned to his farm and continued to have visions until his death in 1926. He saw events that would happen in the 20th and 21st centuries, such as the World Wars, the Cold War, the fall of communism, the end of apartheid, the emergence of Nelson Mandela as a leader, the farm murders, the corruption of the ANC government, and the role of Russia and Donald Trump in the final conflict between good and evil. He also saw events that have not yet happened, such as a civil war in South Africa, a nuclear attack on Pretoria, a massive earthquake in Cape Town, and the return of Christ.
 
Siener Van Rensburg's prophecies have been controversial and disputed by many people. Some regard him as a prophet of God who warned his people of their destiny. Others view him as a racist who supported white supremacy and opposed democracy. Some believe that his prophecies are accurate and relevant for today's world. Others think that his prophecies are vague and open to interpretation.
 
Regardless of what one thinks of Siener Van Rensburg and his prophecies, there is no doubt that he was a remarkable and influential figure in South African history. His books are still widely read and discussed by many people who are interested in his visions and their meanings. His legacy lives on as a voice of a prophet who spoke to his people and to the world.
