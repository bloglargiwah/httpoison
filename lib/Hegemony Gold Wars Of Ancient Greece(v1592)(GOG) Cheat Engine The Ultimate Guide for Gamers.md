If you want to improve your skills and strategies in Hegemony Gold Wars Of Ancient Greece, here are some tips and tricks that you can use:

- Build military units where you need them and then rebase them to a city with more population for recruitment[^1^]. This way, you can save time and resources by not moving units across long distances.
- Use allied spear men and peltasts for garrisons, not native Macedonian units[^1^]. Allied units have lower morale and cannot level up, so they are better suited for defending cities than fighting on the front lines.
- The major bonus native troops have is that they have more morale and can level up[^1^]. Leveling up increases their combat effectiveness and unlocks new abilities. Try to keep your native units alive and engaged in battles to level them up faster.
- Sheep units spawn in winter, so make sure to use up all the low supply sheep units before winter so they can spawn again in full supply in winter[^2^]. Sheep units are essential for supplying your cities and armies with food, especially in remote areas.
- Mines produce gold, but you need 40 people in the mine to get the maximum value out of it[^2^]. Worker units cost 20 gold and only have 20 people in them, so if you put two worker units in a mine, you will only make 40 gold from the mine. Slave units cost 0 gold and can have up to 40 people in them, so it is highly recommended to use slaves in mines that are never raided. Slaves can only come from routing enemy units, while worker units can be easily replaced from cities.
- If a city is low on food and there are no sheep units nearby, you can upgrade the roads to increase supply, but that increases upkeep of the road as well[^2^]. Another way is to get a worker unit and load up supplies from another city and travel to the low supply city.
- Catapults are very useful in sieges. The more the better[^2^]. Catapults can damage enemy walls and towers, making it easier for your infantry to breach the city. They can also fire at enemy units from a safe distance, causing morale damage and casualties.
- Peltasts can be useful in battle as they can stay behind the hoplites and pepper the enemy while they are engaged with the hoplites[^2^]. Peltasts are ranged units that can throw javelins at the enemy. They are effective against lightly armored units and can also harass enemy cavalry.
- Be wary of Athens and Persia as they enjoy using ships to raid deep within your lands[^2^]. Naval warfare is an important aspect of Hegemony Gold Wars Of Ancient Greece. You need to protect your coastlines and trade routes from enemy raids. You also need to build your own navy to challenge your rivals on the sea.
- In naval combat, try to ram the ships on their side as it deals the most damage[^2^]. Ramming the front or back will do little to no damage. You can also use fire ships to set enemy ships on fire, causing them to lose morale and eventually sink.
- Always equip your generals to your units as they bring extra morale and skills[^2^]. Generals are special units that can boost the performance of your troops. They can also use abilities such as rally, charge, or inspire to turn the tide of battle. Generals can be killed or captured by the enemy, so keep them safe.
- Keep in mind that some factions have unique units or buffs to their units[^2^]. For example, Macedon has the Companion unit, which is a powerful cavalry unit that can charge through enemy lines. Sparta has buffs to their morale for their units, making them more resilient in combat. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of each faction and adapt your tactics accordingly.
