## Steinberg Virtual Guitarist 2 FX Review
 
Steinberg Virtual Guitarist 2 FX is an updated version of the original Virtual Guitarist, which was released in 2002. It combines the features of Virtual Guitarist and Virtual Guitarist Electric Edition, offering both acoustic and electric guitar sounds. Unlike Real Guitar 2L, which is based on multisampled instruments, Virtual Guitarist 2 FX is based on pre-recorded phrases in various styles and genres, which are pitch- and tempo-shifted to fit your project.
 
Virtual Guitarist 2 FX comes with 25 'players' or styles, each with three sizes of chord libraries. The larger libraries provide more chord types and variations, such as sus4, add9, dim7, and so on. You can also adjust the complexity and variation of the phrases using the Latch and Variation knobs. The Latch knob determines how many notes are played per chord, while the Variation knob changes the rhythmic pattern or strumming style. You can also use keyswitches to change the variation on the fly.
 
Virtual Guitarist 2 FX also provides some effects and sound-shaping options for each player. You can choose from different amp models and cabinets for the electric guitars, or different microphone positions for the acoustic guitars. You can also add some EQ, chorus, delay, and reverb to enhance the sound. The sound quality of Virtual Guitarist 2 FX is very good, and the phrases sound natural and realistic over a wide range of tempos.
 
However, Virtual Guitarist 2 FX also has some limitations. For one thing, it only provides rhythm guitar parts, not solos or leads. For another thing, it does not allow you to edit the MIDI data of the phrases, so you are stuck with whatever is provided by the program. You can only change the chord type and variation, but not the notes or timing. This can make it difficult to create custom parts or match specific songs. Furthermore, Virtual Guitarist 2 FX is quite resource-intensive, and requires a lot of RAM and hard disk space.
 
In conclusion, Steinberg Virtual Guitarist 2 FX is a useful tool for creating realistic guitar parts quickly and easily. It offers a wide range of styles and sounds, and can follow your chords and tempo seamlessly. However, it is not very flexible or editable, and it does not provide any solo or lead options. If you are looking for a more 'playable' instrument that allows you to create your own phrases and solos, you might want to check out Real Guitar 2L instead.
