If you have downloaded a file named Sandy0903.rar, you might be wondering what it is and how to open it. In this article, we will explain what a RAR file is, why it is used, and how you can extract its contents on Windows or macOS.
 
## What Is a RAR File?
 
A RAR file (short for a Roshal Archive Compressed file) is a compressed file, or data container, that holds one or more other files and folders inside of it. Think of a RAR file like a regular folder on your computer, where there are sometimes many other files and folders inside of it for the purpose of organizing them. However, unlike a normal folder, a RAR file needs special software to open and "extract" out the contents.

RAR files are often used to compress large files or collections of files for easier transmission or storage. They can also be protected with a password and encrypted so that their contents stay hidden unless you know the password.
 
## How to Open a RAR File on Windows
 
Windows computers don't have a built-in ability to open RAR files. If you double-click or double-tap a RAR file without having specific software installed to open it, you'll probably see one of the following messages: "Windows cannot open this file" or "How do you want to open this type of file (.rar)?"
 
To open a RAR file on Windows, you need to install a file extractor program that supports the RAR format. One of the most popular and free options is 7-Zip[^4^], which can open RAR files as well as other archive formats.
 
After you've downloaded and installed 7-Zip from their website, you're good to go. You can double-click any RAR file to open it in 7-ZIP and view or extract the files. If you know you want to extract the files, you can do it without even opening 7-Zip. Right-click any RAR file, point to the "7-Zip" menu, and then select one of the "Extract" options, depending on where you want to extract the files.
 
Note that if you've got a multi-part set of .RAR files, you'll want to extract the first file in the setâ7-Zip will handle the other files in the set automatically.
 
## How to Open a RAR File on macOS
 
There are not as many choices for opening RAR files on macOS as on the more popular Windows platform. There are still a few, however. We recommend the free app "The Unarchiver"[^5^], which has great support for multi-part archive files.

After installation, you can launch The Unarchiver to associate file types with the app. After associating file types, you can extract a RAR archive by simply double-clicking the file. The Unarchiver create a folder with the same name as the archive, and then extracts its contents to the new folder.
 
Note that if you're working with a multi-part RAR archive, you'll need to open the first file in the set. The Unarchiver will handle the additional files in the set automatically.
 
## Conclusion
 
Sandy0903.rar is not a mysterious or dangerous file type. It is just a compressed archive that contains other files and folders inside of it. To access its contents, you need to use a file extractor program that supports the RAR format. Once you do that, you can view or use the files as you would any other file on your computer.
