## What is iZotope Neutron?
 
iZotope Neutron is a mixing plugin that uses artificial intelligence to analyze your audio tracks and suggest optimal settings for EQ, compression, saturation, reverb, and more. It also features a visual mixer, a tonal balance control, a track assistant, and a masking meter that help you create balanced and clear mixes.
 
## How does iZotope Neutron work?
 
iZotope Neutron works by using machine learning to identify the genre, style, and sonic characteristics of your audio tracks. Based on this analysis, it offers you presets and suggestions for each track that match the overall sound of your project. You can then tweak the settings to your liking or use the track assistant to automatically apply the best settings for each track.
 
## What are the main features of iZotope Neutron?
 
iZotope Neutron has many features that make it a powerful mixing plugin for music producers. Some of the main features are:
 
- **EQ:** A dynamic EQ that can adjust the frequency response of your tracks based on the input signal. It also has a spectral shaping mode that can add warmth, brightness, or air to your tracks.
- **Compressor:** A multiband compressor that can control the dynamics of your tracks with precision and flexibility. It also has a vintage mode that can add character and color to your tracks.
- **Exciter:** A multiband saturator that can add harmonic distortion and richness to your tracks. It also has a blend control that can mix the dry and wet signals for parallel processing.
- **Transient Shaper:** A multiband transient shaper that can enhance or reduce the attack and sustain of your tracks. It also has a contour control that can shape the envelope of your transients.
- **Gate:** A multiband gate that can remove unwanted noise and bleed from your tracks. It also has a hysteresis control that can prevent chattering and false triggering.
- **Limiter:** A brickwall limiter that can prevent clipping and distortion in your tracks. It also has a true peak mode that can ensure compliance with loudness standards.
- **Visual Mixer:** A graphical interface that lets you adjust the volume, pan, width, and tone of your tracks in a single window. You can also group and solo tracks, mute or bypass plugins, and create snapshots of your mixes.
- **Tonal Balance Control:** A metering tool that lets you monitor the frequency balance of your mix in relation to a target curve. You can also adjust the EQ of any track from within the tonal balance control window.
- **Track Assistant:** A feature that listens to your audio and automatically sets up an optimal starting point for your mix. You can choose from three modes: balanced, warm, or upfront.
- **Masking Meter:** A feature that detects and displays frequency collisions between tracks that can cause muddiness or masking. You can also use the inverse link function to adjust the EQ of both tracks simultaneously.
