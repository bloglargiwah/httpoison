- Never share your personal or financial information with anyone online.
- Always inspect the item in person before paying and picking it up. If possible, meet in a public and well-lit place with other people around.
- If you are having an item shipped, make sure you get a tracking number and confirmation of delivery.
- If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid deals that are extremely low-priced, vague, or suspicious.

- Features: You might want to look for some features that can enhance your experience, such as ice makers, water dispensers, smart technology, adjustable shelves, drawers, and more.

## How to Maintain Your Refrigerator or Freezer
 
Once you have bought your refrigerator or freezer on Facebook Marketplace, you need to take good care of it to make it last longer and perform better. Here are some tips on how to maintain your refrigerator or freezer:

- Clean it regularly: You should wipe down the interior and exterior of your refrigerator or freezer with a damp cloth and mild soap. You should also remove any spills, crumbs, or stains as soon as possible.
- Defrost it periodically: If your refrigerator or freezer is not frost-free, you should defrost it every few months or when the ice buildup is more than a quarter-inch thick. You should unplug it, empty it, and let the ice melt completely before wiping it dry and plugging it back in.
- Check the seals: You should check the seals or gaskets of your refrigerator or freezer doors and make sure they are not cracked, torn, or loose. You should also clean them with a soft cloth and warm water to remove any dirt or debris that might prevent them from closing properly.
- Replace the filters: If your refrigerator or freezer has a water filter or an air filter, you should replace them according to the manufacturer's instructions. This will ensure that you have clean and fresh water and air in your appliance.
