# Charlie Chaplin Complete Filmography (87 Movies) 13 DVDs: A Review
 
Charlie Chaplin (1889â1977) was an English-born actor, comedian, filmmaker and composer who became one of the most iconic figures of cinema history. He is best known for his "Tramp" persona, a lovable vagabond who often finds himself in hilarious and poignant situations. Chaplin wrote, directed, produced and starred in most of his films, which spanned from the silent era to the sound era. He was also a pioneer of visual comedy, slapstick, social satire and political commentary.
