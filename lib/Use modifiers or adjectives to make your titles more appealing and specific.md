MKV files are a popular format for storing multimedia content, such as video, audio, and subtitles. MKV stands for Matroska, which is an open source project that aims to create a universal container for multimedia files. However, not all media players support MKV files, and sometimes you may need to edit, split, merge, or extract some elements from them. That's where MKVToolNix GUI comes in handy.
