# The Estill Voice Model: A Comprehensive Guide for Singers and Speakers
 
The Estill Voice Model is a system of voice training that aims to help singers and speakers achieve vocal freedom, flexibility and control. The model was developed by Jo Estill, a renowned voice researcher and educator, who studied the anatomy and physiology of the human voice for over 40 years. The model is based on the premise that every sound we make is a combination of different structures in the vocal tract, which can be isolated and manipulated independently. By learning how to adjust these structures, we can produce a wide range of vocal qualities, such as speech, opera, belt, twang, sob and more.

The Estill Voice Model is based on the idea that every voice has six basic components: source, filter, power, pitch, quality and loudness. The source is the vocal folds, which vibrate to produce sound. The filter is the vocal tract, which shapes the sound into different frequencies. The power is the airflow from the lungs, which drives the vibration of the vocal folds. The pitch is the frequency of the sound, which depends on the length and tension of the vocal folds. The quality is the timbre or tone color of the sound, which depends on the shape and size of the vocal tract. The loudness is the intensity or volume of the sound, which depends on the amount and pressure of the airflow.

The Estill Voice Model teaches how to control each of these components independently and in combination, using a set of 13 figures for voice control. These figures are specific adjustments of the vocal structures that affect the sound production. For example, one figure is larynx height, which changes the pitch and quality of the sound. Another figure is false vocal folds, which can add or remove noise from the sound. By mastering these figures, we can create any vocal sound we want, without strain or damage to our voice.
 
The Estill Voice Model also introduces the concept of voice qualities, which are distinct vocal sounds that have characteristic features and effects. There are six voice qualities in the model: speech, falsetto, sob, twang, opera and belt. Each voice quality has a specific recipe of figures that produce it. For example, speech quality is produced by a low larynx, thin vocal folds and a neutral mouth shape. Falsetto quality is produced by a high larynx, thin vocal folds and a wide mouth shape. Sob quality is produced by a low larynx, thick vocal folds and a narrow mouth shape. Twang quality is produced by a high larynx, thin vocal folds and a narrow mouth shape. Opera quality is produced by a low larynx, thick vocal folds and a wide mouth shape. Belt quality is produced by a high larynx, thick vocal folds and a wide mouth shape.
