The Transas GMDSS Simulator TGS 5000 is a software-based system that simulates the actual Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) equipment used on board ships. It is designed to train and examine ship specialists who work on obtaining a General Operator Certificate (GOC) or Restricted Operator Certificate (ROC). It also supports Search and Rescue (SAR) operations and Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) operator training.
 
The simulator covers all aspects of radio communication in accordance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards and recommendations. It includes the following modules:

- VHF DSC (Digital Selective Calling)
- MF/HF DSC
- Inmarsat-C
- NAVTEX
- EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon)
- SART (Search and Rescue Transponder)
- Radiotelex

The simulator can simulate various scenarios of distress, urgency, safety and routine communication, as well as interference, propagation conditions, equipment failures and malfunctions. The instructor can monitor and control the students' performance, as well as create and edit scenarios and exercises.
 
The simulator can also simulate the SAILOR 6000 console, which is a modern GMDSS equipment suite that consists of:

- SAILOR 6222 VHF DSC
- SAILOR 6301 MF/HF DSC
- SAILOR 6110 Inmarsat-C GMDSS SES (Ship Earth Station)
- SAILOR 6300 MF/HF Radiotelex
- SAILOR 6103 alarm panel

The simulator can be integrated with the TGS 6000 console, which is a hardware-based system that replicates the SAILOR 6000 console. The TGS 6000 console provides a realistic and immersive training environment for the students.
 
The Transas GMDSS Simulator TGS 5000 is a powerful and flexible tool that can help ship specialists to acquire and maintain the necessary skills and knowledge for radio communication in maritime operations.

To use the Transas GMDSS Simulator TGS 5000, the instructor needs to set up a network of student workstations and instructor stations. The instructor can choose from a variety of predefined exercises or create custom ones using the exercise editor. The exercises can be assigned to individual students or groups of students. The instructor can also select the type of console to be simulated: SAILOR 6000, TGS 6000 or generic.
 
The students can access the simulator from their workstations and interact with the simulated GMDSS equipment using the mouse and keyboard. The simulator provides realistic audio and visual feedback, as well as error messages and alarms. The students can communicate with other stations, such as coast stations, rescue coordination centers, other ships and aircrafts, using the appropriate frequencies and protocols. The students can also perform various tasks, such as sending distress alerts, acknowledging messages, requesting weather forecasts, logging events and printing reports.
 
The instructor can monitor the students' progress and performance from the instructor station. The instructor can view the students' screens, listen to their audio communication, send messages and instructions, introduce faults and malfunctions, change environmental conditions and evaluate the students' results. The instructor can also record and replay the sessions for debriefing and assessment purposes.
