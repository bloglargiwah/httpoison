If you are interested in learning more about the history of Indonesia, you might want to download the film Penumpasan Pengkhianatan G 30 S/PKI Full. This film is a docudrama that depicts the events of the 30 September Movement, a failed coup attempt by a group of Indonesian military officers who claimed to be acting on behalf of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) in 1965. The film shows how the coup plotters kidnapped and killed six Indonesian Army generals and one first officer, and how the government and the army responded by launching a massive anti-communist purge that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths.
 
The film was directed by Arifin C. Noer and produced by the Indonesian Army's Department of Information in 1984. It was intended to be a propaganda tool to justify the New Order regime of President Suharto, who came to power after the coup attempt. The film was mandatory viewing for students and civil servants every year on 30 September until 1998, when Suharto was ousted by a popular uprising. The film has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies, distortions, and exaggerations, as well as its graphic violence and torture scenes.
