Aura Kingdom is a popular anime-style massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that offers a colorful and immersive fantasy world. You can create your own character, choose from various classes and skills, explore different regions, and interact with other players. If you are looking for a fun and engaging game that will keep you entertained for hours, Aura Kingdom might be the perfect choice for you.
 
However, downloading and installing Aura Kingdom can be a bit tricky, especially if you have a slow or unstable internet connection. The official website of the game requires you to download a large installer file that might take a long time or fail to complete. That's why some players prefer to use torrents to download Aura Kingdom instead. Torrents are a way of sharing files over the internet that allows you to download them faster and more reliably.

In this article, we will show you how to download and play Aura Kingdom using torrents. We will also give you some tips on how to stay safe and avoid any legal issues while torrenting. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download and install a torrent client. A torrent client is a software that allows you to download files from other users who are sharing them. There are many torrent clients available online, but some of the most popular ones are uTorrent, BitTorrent, qBittorrent, and Vuze. You can choose any of them, but make sure to download them from their official websites and avoid any fake or malicious versions.
2. Find a reliable torrent site that offers Aura Kingdom files. A torrent site is a website that hosts torrent files, which are small files that contain information about the files you want to download. There are many torrent sites on the internet, but not all of them are safe or trustworthy. Some of them might contain malware, viruses, or fake files that can harm your computer or waste your time. That's why you should stick to well-known and reputable torrent sites that have positive reviews and feedback from other users. Some of the best Kickass Torrents alternative sites in 2022 that offer Aura Kingdom files are YTS[^1^], 1337X[^1^], RARBG[^1^], The Pirate Bay[^1^], EZTV[^1^], and LimeTorrents[^1^]. You can also use Microsoft Sway[^2^] or waggners.com[^3^] to find Aura Kingdom torrents.
3. Download the torrent file of Aura Kingdom and open it with your torrent client. Once you find a torrent site that offers Aura Kingdom files, you need to download the torrent file that corresponds to the version of the game you want to play. For example, if you want to play Aura Kingdom on Steam, you need to download the Steam version of the game. If you want to play Aura Kingdom on Aeria Games, you need to download the Aeria Games version of the game. Make sure to check the file size, seeders, leechers, comments, and ratings of the torrent file before downloading it. Seeders are users who have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Leechers are users who are downloading the file but have not completed it yet. The more seeders and less leechers a torrent file has, the faster and more reliable it will be. Comments and ratings can help you determine if the file is genuine and working or not.
4. Wait for the download to finish and run the installer file. After you open the torrent file with your torrent client, it will start downloading the Aura Kingdom files from other users who are sharing them. Depending on your internet speed and the number of seeders and leechers, this might take from a few minutes to several hours. You can monitor the progress of the download on your torrent client interface. Once the download is complete, you will find an installer file in your downloads folder or wherever you chose to save it. Run this file and follow the instructions on the screen to install Aura Kingdom on your computer.
5. Launch Aura Kingdom and enjoy playing it. After you install Aura Kingdom on your computer, you can launch it from your desktop shortcut or your start menu. You will need to create an account or log in with an existing one to play the game online. You can also customize your settings, choose your server, create your character, and start your adventure in Aura Kingdom.
