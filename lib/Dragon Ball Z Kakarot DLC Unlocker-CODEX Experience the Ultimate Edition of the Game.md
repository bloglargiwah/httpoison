Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is a popular action RPG game based on the anime series. It features the story of Goku and his friends as they fight against various enemies and explore the world of Dragon Ball. The game also has several downloadable content (DLC) packs that add new stories, characters, and features to the game.
 
However, some players may not be able to access the DLCs due to various reasons, such as region restrictions, lack of funds, or technical issues. Fortunately, there is a way to unlock all the DLCs in Dragon Ball Z Kakarot with a crack from CODEX, a group of hackers who specialize in cracking games. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Download the Dragon Ball Z Kakarot DLC Unlocker-CODEX from a reliable source. You can find it on various torrent sites or file-sharing platforms. Make sure to scan the file for viruses before opening it.
2. Extract the file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder named CODEX with several files inside.
3. Copy all the files from the CODEX folder and paste them into the folder where you installed Dragon Ball Z Kakarot. You may need to overwrite some existing files, so make sure to back them up first.
4. Run the game as administrator and enjoy all the DLCs unlocked. You can check the DLCs menu in the game to see which ones are available.

Note that this method may not work for future updates or patches of the game, so you may need to download a new crack from CODEX if that happens. Also, this method may violate the terms of service of the game developer and publisher, so use it at your own risk.
